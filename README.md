**Notes**
- It is in the very early development stage and only works on Android fow now. 
- It also requires a custom build of Mapbox Native GL SDK.

## Getting Started

To build this plugin and the example, you need to register a MapBox Access Token.

Then, create a **local.properties** file in the **example/android** folder with the following content:

```
mapbox.accessToken="YOUR MAPBOX ACCESS TOKEN"
```
